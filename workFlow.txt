-> Total CrowdFunding -> if the amount is large , but neha has some time
-> Total loan -> if the amount is very large , but neha wants it on the very urgent basis

-> If the neha selects for the Crowdfunding then we are going to ask neha whether she want to give some perks to the donors , for donating particular amount.

*** Donor giving donations -> 5000 -> get perks from neha ***
